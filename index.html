      <h2>A Dubious Demise</h2>
      Recent cutting edge investigative journalism by C. F. News has discover yet unpublished reports of the activities
      Elvis "The King Presley", which have been compiled here.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      <h2>The First Sign</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Date: August 23, 1977</li>
        <li>Location: </li>
      </ul>
        Shortly after his supposed demise, his tomb was found to be completely empty, as if never used. This discovery was only
        recently declassified.
    </p>
    <p class="p3">  
      <h2>A Musical Mothman?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Date: 1966-current</li>
        <li>Location: Point Pleasant, Vermont</li>
      </ul>
        Hundreds of sighting across the state of Vermont of this supposed "Mothman" have cropped up over the years, originating from
        the state of Vermont. These sighting began in 1966, and grew drastically during the height of Mr. Presley's fame. Due to the 
        similarity of their silhouettes, and the presence of his voice and a "sick guitar solo", many have concluded this to be one 
        of the King's dark secrets.
    </p>
    <p class="p4">
      <h2>Debut for a Despot</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Date:v1980-1983</li>
        <li>Location:vUnknown</li>
      </ul>
        Here we clearly see Mr Presley shaking hands with Darth Vader, celebrating their yet unreleased collaborative biopic 
        "The King and I". It should be noted that Mr. Vader, who could not be reached for comment, is the right hand of the 
        current galactic despot, a literal evil mummy in a bath robe.
    </p>
    <p class="p5">
      <h2>Dine and Dash</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Date: 1985-1991</li>
        <li>Location:vUnknow planet across the cosmos.</li>
      </ul>
        In Douglas Adams' final installment of his seminal work "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy", Elvis is clearly 
        encountered by known thursday hater and experienced hitchhiker Arthur Dent. This siting, coupled with it's location 
        of a dinner halfway across the universe, proves his continued vitality and gives support to the evidence of his extra-
        terrestrial influence, if not origin.
    </p>
    <p class="p6">
      <h2>The Ecto King</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Date: March 3, 2020</li>
        <li>Location: Colorado Springs, Colorado</li>
      </ul>
        Local resident [NAME REDACTED] found the apparition of the King in her kitchen helping himself to her sandwiches before 
        vanishing, sandwiches in tow, into the aether. When asked how she managed to snap such a fine quality picture before he
        left, Mrs. [NAME REDACTED] simply said "it's 2020 ya unhinged buffoon, everyone has a camera on their phone now". Is this
        proof that the King has finally passed on? And if so, why are we still not free of him?
